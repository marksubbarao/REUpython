      "Part 1: Open a Terminal\n",
      "\n",
      "The command line in a Terminal is the starting point for astrophysics research. From the command line, you can write/move/copy files and start software.\n",
      "\n",
      "To open a Terminal in UNIX, double-click on X11\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 2: Understand the Directory Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The directory architecture used by UNIX is a hierarchical tree structure. When you first open a Terminal, you land in your \u201chome\u201d directory. Instead of clicking on folders, you navigate through the directory structure by \u201cchanging directories\u201d using the command \u2018cd\u2019 at the prompt in your Terminal. The directory that you are currently sitting in at a prompt is your \u201cworking directory\u201d.\n",
      "\n",
      "The top of the tree is the \u201croot\u201d directory, designated with a slash sign (/). Directory names build on the root directory, with a slash designating a new branch in the directory structure. For example, the full (absolute) path name for my home directory would be \u201c/home/trouille/\u201d. Directories can also have relative path names, which are interpreted as starting from the present working directory. If we were in the \u201c/home/\u201d directory, the relative path name to my home directory would be \u201ctrouille\u201d.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 3: List the Contents of a Directory\n",
      "\n",
      "The command line accepts commands in a language called \u201cbash&rdquo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The command \u2018ls\u2019 (note: the first letter is an \u2018L\u2019) is used to list the contents of a directory. The \u2018ls\u2019 command can be invoked with a variety of options, which modify its action. Under Unix, command options are preceded by a hyphen. A few of the more useful forms of \u2018ls\u2019 include:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ls              #lists all filenames\n",
      "    ls \u2013l          #includes dates, sizes, etc. Note: -l is \u2018minus L\u2019.\n",
      "    ls \u2013p         #distinguishes between directories and regular files\n",
      "\n",
      "Try each of these 'ls' commands in order and notice the way they indicate your home directory's contents. Note: You can combine different options when executing a UNIX command, for example:\n",

      "Part 4: Create a Class Folder\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a new directory in which you will save your class work by using the command \u2018mkdir\u2019. You can call this directory anything you\u2019d like, but avoid whitespaces and try to name it something that makes sense, like \u201cREU\u201d (referred to below as \u201cyourClassDirectory\u201d). At the command line in your Terminal, type:\n",
      "\n",
      "    cd\n",
      "    mkdir REU\n",
      "\n",
      "Now list the contents of your current working directory to verify that your new directory has been created. Type:\n",

      "Learn where you are in the directory structure by typing:\n",

      "The \u201ccd\u201d command moves you around in the directory structure, and takes an argument that is the desired destination directory. The argument can be either a relative or an absolute pathname. Type:\n",
      "\n",
      "    cd yourClassDirectory\n",
      "\n",
      "This will enter you into the directory that you've just created and the system will move your current working directory to \u201c/home/yourname/yourClassDirectory\u201d (or whatever you\u2019ve chosen to call it).\n",
      "\n",
      "UNIX provides some useful shortcuts for navigating directories. Double dots, \u201c..\u201d refer to the parent directory. You can therefore move from /home/yourname/yourClassDirectory into /home/yourname by simply typing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    cd ..\n",
      "\n",
      "And you can always get back to your /home directory by typing:\n",

      "Part 7: Copy a File\n",
      "\n",
      "The command \u201ccp\u201d is used to copy files. To make a copy of the text file you just created, type:\n",
      "\n",
      "    cp -i testEdit.txt testEdit2.txt               #\u2018-i\u2019 tells the \u201ccp\u201d command not to overwrite an existing testEdit2.txt\n",

      "\n",
      "Part 8: Filenames and Wildcards\n",
      "\n",
      "Files in the current working directory can be referred to simply by their filename. However, the name of a file includes its full pathname, such as: \n",
      "home/trouille/testEdit.txt, where the last element, \u201ctestEdit.txt\u201d, is the file name.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, UNIX allows you to select a subset of the objects of interest. For example, to obtain a listing of all files that end in \u201c.txt\u201d, you would type:\n",

      "Part 10: Troubleshooting\n",
      "\n",
      "If you find that the cursor has gone away, with no indication of ever returning, try the old standby CTRL-c. This means hold down the Ctrl key and hit \u201cc\u201d. This ought to kill the hung process. If this fails, try CTRL-z, where you hit \u201cz\u201d instead of \u201cc\u201d.
